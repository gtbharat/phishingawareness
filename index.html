		<h2>What is Phishing?</h2>

		<p>Phishing is a type of cyber attack where the attacker impersonates a trusted entity, such as a bank or a social media site, to trick the victim into divulging sensitive information such as usernames, passwords, and credit card details. Phishing attacks often use email or instant messaging to lure victims into clicking on a link or downloading an attachment that contains malware.</p>

		<h2>How to Spot a Phishing Email</h2>

		<ul>
			<li>Urgent or threatening language: Phishing emails often use language that creates a sense of urgency or fear, such as threatening to close an account or warning of a security breach.</li>
			<li>Suspicious links or attachments: Phishing emails often contain links or attachments that appear to be from a legitimate source, but actually lead to a fake website or contain malware.</li>
			<li>Poor grammar or spelling: Phishing emails often contain grammatical or spelling errors, as they are typically written by non-native English speakers.</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>How to Protect Yourself from Phishing</h2>

		<ul>
			<li>Please be wary of any emails asking for passwords. Never send passwords, bank account numbers, or other private information in an email without verifying the source.</li>
			<li>Be cautious about opening attachments and downloading files from emails, regardless of who sent them. These files can contain viruses or other malware that can weaken your computer's security. If you are not expecting an email with an attachment from someone, such as a fax or a PDF, please call and ask them if they indeed sent the email. If not, let them know they are sending out Phishing emails and need to change their email password immediately.</li> 
			<li>Never enter private or personal information into a popup window.</li>
			<li>If there is a link in an email, use your mouse to hover over that link to see if it is sending you to where it claims to be, this can thwart many phishing attempts.</li>
			<li>Look for 'https://' and a lock icon in the address bar before entering any private information on a website.</li>
			<li>Look for spelling and bad grammar. Cybercriminals are not known for their grammar and spelling. Professional companies or organizations usually have staff that will not allow a mass email like this to go out to its users. If you notice mistakes in an email, it might be a scam.</li>
			<li>Lookout for External Email banners. This will give you an idea that the email originated from external domain.</li>
